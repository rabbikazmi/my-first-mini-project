# my-first-mini-project
This project, titled "Healthshield", is a mini project developed as part of my coursework.
The primary purpose of this project is to create a rule-based vaccine chatbot that will ensure that the
users are getting accurate information about vaccines whenever they stumble upon a clinic or health based websites.
As these are 24/7 available and are also inexpensive as compared to AI or trained chatbots, these will help the small clinics
in embedding these chatbots in their worksites.
